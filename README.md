Business Insights:

The analysis above generated numerous insights related to the emotional tone expressed in the text data. Three main insights are:
1. The dataset contains reviews of different topics, such as, food, movies, phone, headset, and other products.
2. The frequent occurrence of positive terms such as "phone," "food," and "service," as well as the prevalence of negative expressions like "bad," "worst," and "disappointed," serves as valuable indicators for investigating product and service quality. These commonly used words not only offer insights into customer sentiments but also pinpoint specific areas that may necessitate attention or improvement.
3. The overall sentiment scores are positive using bing et al and NRC functions despite that the number of negative reviews is more than positive reviews in the dataset.
   
Recommendations
1. Identify specific instances or areas where negative words like "bad," "disappointed," and "worse" are mentioned. Address these concerns promptly and work towards improvements. 
2. Consider implementing a customer loyalty program or offering incentives for customers who leave positive reviews. This can encourage more satisfied customers to share their positive experiences.
3. Keep an eye on reviews of competitors in the same industry. Understanding what customers appreciate or dislike about similar products/services can provide insights for differentiation and improvement.
